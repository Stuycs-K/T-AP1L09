# Required Diagrams


You will be CREATING YOUR OWN diagrams and adding them to your repo. You will be uploading an image file that can be a photograph of your hand drawn diagram, or created in a paint/diagram program.

You must add your diagrams just like a regular source file. Put them in your local repo, and add/commit/push.

A diagram of `add(index,value)` is required, include 3 cases: empty, add to front, add to middle. (add to end is same concept as add to front)

A diagram of `remove()` is required. Since remove(value) or remove(index) are identical, so provide either one. Include removeing the front, and removing middle.


Update this README.md file to include your images. (add the image to your repo, and change the cat.jpg links above.)
